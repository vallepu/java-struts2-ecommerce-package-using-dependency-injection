
	need to iterate thru the product list that is loaded into the page. they choose
	a category, then productaction loads a list of products correlating to that category.
	
	when the jsp page Categories.jsp is loaded and the action classes product list is iterated thru
	and a printed layout of products is loaded into the jsp page.
	
	need to look into how to many to layout per product column. 
 	what if its on an iphone vs a regular screen?
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	PROBLEM: cant use decorators when u need to process lists and stuff from action classes.
 			im almost certain that it doesnt process this. 
 				TO BE SURE, CHECK.....
 				Outcome of Test: functional or non functional?
 				well, in the decorator.xml file there is no place to set what action class goes
 				to what decorator with which pattern...
 				
 					NOTE: DECORATOR THING might work since were having a class that handles this. it all depends
 					on how the class gets its info. checking....
 					,looks like its getting its info from an action class,but if we used injectors and created everything
 					manually in the class itself with no action classes needed then perhaps the decorator will
 					be able to retrieve the data without the need for an actionclass which would then allow us to pu the 
 					suckerfish categories in the decorator which looks super neat.
 					NOTE: THIS will not work as the decorators dont access any action classes and you can only write
 					html in them, no java tag libraries.  :(
